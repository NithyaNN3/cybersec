# Pentesting
- manual or automated techniques that simulate an attack on an org's security arrangements
- black box testing 

**Black Box testing** - attacks without prior knowledge of internal workings. Checks the accuracy of your system without too much concern about the internal implementations
**White box testing** - deeply analyzes the system by checking all the internal coding

## Types
1) Application pen testing
2) Infrastructure pentesting
3) Device pentesting
4) Mobile pentesting
5) Wireless pentesting
and so on..

## Testing Prep
1. Define scope
2. determine testing applications
3. define purpose and limitation[
4. Prepare test environment, data
5. Select tester and timeframe

# Network Pentest Phases
- follow a methodology like OWASP, PTES, NIST
1) Gather information:
  - using OSINT (open source intelligence) framework
  - port scanning and service enumeration
  - foot printing, directory brute forcing
  - understand how target system works
2) Threat modelling:
  - identify target and draw data flow diagrams
  - find technologies in use
  - understand attack surface and create attacks
  - create possible malicious payloads
  - list possible attacks
